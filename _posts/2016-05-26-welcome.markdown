That is my 3rd attempt to make a blog. Idea is to make a stable ground for the future that will allow individuals with similar
professional interests contacting me if needed.


This time it is here on github with great support of Jekyll which is a blogging engine I use for this purpose.


Will it stand the test of time? I don't know.
